## Running Tests

The Python `nose` package is used for finding, running, and assessing the coverage of the unit tests.

Run the tests with the following command:
```
nosetests --with-cov
```
## Tranlational Information

There were a lot of "common" functions in Arguments.groovy and the corresponding functionality in `common.py` has been documented in that file.
