# scripts

This directory is used to stored any scripts relevant to the pipeline, but are not used directly within the pipeline.

Any scripts stored within the root of this folder should be be considered in use and reusable (i.e. they should be updated, deleted or moved if any changes within the pipeline affect them).

The `analysis` directory is used for archived single purpose analysis scripts. 

The `maintenance` directory is used for archived single purpose maintenance scripts. 

The scripts within `analysis` and `maintenance` can be used for reference or reusing code but are not expected to be immediately reusable as they may refer to depracated or removed functionality within the pipeline.
